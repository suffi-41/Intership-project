                <b>HTML</b>(HyperText Markup Language) <b>Css</b>(Cascading Style Sheets) and <b>Js</b>(Javascript)
                language used for creating this website<br>
                <div class="script">
                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <div>
                        which stands for "HyperText Markup Language," is the basic language used to create and structure
                        websites on the internet. Think of it as the building blocks that define how a webpage looks and
                        what content it contains. With HTML, you can create headings, paragraphs, images, links, and
                        other elements that make up a webpage. It's like giving instructions to your web browser on how
                        to display information and where to place different parts of a webpage.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="script">
                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <div>
                        CSS, short for "Cascading Style Sheets," is a language used to control the visual presentation
                        and layout of web pages that are written in HTML. While HTML defines the structure and content
                        of a webpage, CSS is responsible for making that content look visually appealing and
                        well-organized.
                        <br>

                        In simpler terms, CSS allows you to apply styles to HTML elements. These styles can include
                        things like colors, fonts, spacing, borders, and positioning. It's like giving your webpage a
                        set of instructions on how it should be displayed, making it easier to create consistent and
                        attractive designs across different web pages. CSS helps separate the content (HTML) from its
                        appearance (styling), allowing for greater flexibility and maintainability in web design.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="script">
                    <h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
                    <div>
                        JavaScript (often abbreviated as "JS") is a programming language that adds interactivity and
                        dynamic behavior to websites. It's like the "magic" behind the scenes that makes web pages
                        respond to user actions without needing to reload the whole page.
                        <br>

                        With JavaScript, you can create things like pop-up windows, interactive forms, animations, and
                        even more complex applications like online games or real-time chat systems. It allows you to
                        control how elements on a webpage behave, like what happens when you click a button, move your
                        mouse, or submit a form.
                        <br>

                        In short, JavaScript brings life to static web pages by enabling them to react to your actions
                        and provide a more engaging and user-friendly experience.
